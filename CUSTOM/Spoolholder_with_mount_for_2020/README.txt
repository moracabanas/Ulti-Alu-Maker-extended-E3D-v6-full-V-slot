# Summary

<b>Recommends:</b> I'll recommend you take a look at my new 
<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1396652">Flat Filament Spool Holder - No spring- The Claw remake</a>.

##Why this model?#
I needed a new Spoolholder for my version of "Ultimaker 2 Aluminum Extrusion 3D printer" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:811271 and a way to mount it filament spool to my Extrusions and created this one.  

##Remix Source##
I used the "low-friction-um2-spoolholder"  https://www.youmagine.com/designs/low-friction-um2-spoolholder as my source, but ended up changing everything. Everything is slimmed down, reinforced and basically reinvented even though they look pretty much the same at a glance.  

##Changes##
My build does away with the center spacer and instead inserts the Bearings from either end.  It makes for much stronger parts and eliminates the risk of pushing out the ends of the pieces if you overtighten them.  

The finger nut has been slimmed down to make a less obtrusive part.   

The inner spoolholder have had some finger-knobs added to ease the tightening/loosening action.  

**Edit: 7th april 2016**
Updated instructions here. 
In the files you basically find 2 models, where I consider the first model as deprecated - I keep it as the source
Deprectated files:
reinforced_center_threadding_for_spoolholder_608zz_226mm.stl
reinforced_base_with_fingergrib_for_spoolholder608zz_226mm.stl

**Edit: 7. september 2015:**
Added a version of the mount without middle and side-guides. Works the same and I recommend printing with 100% infill (for the mount).  

Added final version of the "slimmed nut"  

Added 3 spacers which you might want to use between the Nut which goes against the Mount and between the base in order to reduce friction slightly. If you use a locking nut, you want to use the 5mm version.  

**Edit the 13th september 2015**
 I added 2 new models where the **Base** and **Center parts* are combined into 1: **inner part 6mm-basehole.stl** and **inner part 15mm-basehole.stl**

**The difference in the two parts**
The depth of the hole in the base, facing your printer: One is 6mm deep, intended for your bearing to sit in there with 1mm going outside to make a bit of space between the base and the printer. The other part has 15mm hole intented for both the bearing and an M8 nut if that fits your build

# Print Settings

Printer: JennyPrinter
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0,2
Infill: 100

Notes: 
Do print with same infill percentage or they will tend to get either awfully tight or Loose.

<ul><li>Do yourself a favor and make the mount 100% infill. Or at least high.</li>
<li>The other parts can be 25% infill with 3 perimeter lines and arond 1mm top/bottom</li>
<li>I printed with 0,2mm layer height.</li>

# Instructions

**You need to print 1 of the 2 following pieces:**
<ul><li>One is 6mm deep, intended for your bearing to sit in there with 1mm going outside to make a bit of space between the base and the printer.
"inner-part-6mm_basehole.stl" </li>
<li>The other part has 15mm hole intented for both the bearing and an M8 nut if that fits your build: "inner-part-15mm_basehole.stl"</li></ul>

**Also need to print**
slimmed_spoolholder_nut.stl

**Might want to print**
I have included 2 Mount pieces I have used on my extrusion printer. 
<ul><li>The "guides" version have "guides" on the sides to grib the sides of a 20x20 extrusion piece
Mount_for_Spoolholder-With-M8nut.stl</li>
<li>The other Mount can be used with any printer, but you might want to just make a hole in your case or find another option: "mount_without_guides_for_spoolholder-with-m8nut.stl"</li>
<li>Various spacers etc are just in case you need some spacers. They are not mandatory in any way</li></ul>

**Assembling**
Bearings goes into either end of the assembly and a spacer is not needed between, as it was from the source.  

##Do not use mixed infill rates## 
Print the parts with the same fill-rate or you are going to have problems fitting them together.
You can see how I had to grib my middle-threadded part with some tool, as I printed it in 100% and it had to be worked a bit (a lot) to fit properly with my end nut, which was 25%  

Holes are 22,6mm to make it easier to "install" the 608ZZ bearings.  My 100% infill middle part had a loose fit for the bearing, but 1 piece of insulation tape around the bearing made that issue go away - minor issue in any case.  

*Support*
You might need some support if you print the Mount with middle and side guides.   

**M8 nuts**
There is room for an M8 locking nut in the mounting piece, but I guess a normal M8 nut would work as well (since the normal type is smaller).  

##BOM:##
2x M8 locking nuts. (you can use normal M8 nuts)  
1x M8 normal nut.  
Some 8mm threadded rod.  
2x 608ZZ bearings.  

**Using these for Ultimaker 2 Aluminum Extrusion 3D printer**
If you are going to Mount 2 filament rolls you need at least one of the mounts to be without guides, or there is not enough room for them vertically.
